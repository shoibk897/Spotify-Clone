This is a Spotify clone project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Author

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Shoib khan, and I'm a second-year college student passionate about web development and creating cool projects like this Spotify clone.

### Background and Interests

I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science, with a particular focus on web development and user interface design. I have a strong interest in front-end technologies and enjoy experimenting with new frameworks and libraries to create engaging user experiences.

### Relevant Projects and Experience

In the past, I've worked on projects ranging from simple static websites to dynamic web applications using frameworks like React.js and Angular. I've also had the opportunity to explore the intersection of music and technology in projects such as a music recommendation system and a MIDI controller interface for digital audio workstations.

### Why I Created This Project

As someone who is passionate about both music and technology, creating a Spotify clone seemed like the perfect way to combine my interests and further develop my skills in web development. I'm excited to share this project with the community and continue learning and growing as a developer.
